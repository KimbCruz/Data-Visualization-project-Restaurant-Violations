# Data Visualization project Restaurant Violations

This dataset contains inspection results for New York City restaurants and college cafeterias (referred to as restaurants) from up to three years before the most recent inspection. 
Its main goal is to offer insights into recent inspections. Restaurants that have closed are removed from the dataset, making it unsuitable for conducting historical comparisons between past and current inspection data.
